# The octonionic trace form

The real part `re : 𝕆 → ℝ` is the normalized trace of left multiplication.  Although `𝕆`
itself is neither commutative nor associative -- `Octonions.non_associative` exhibits a
counterexample -- the *trace* of a product is both symmetric and associative:

* `re_mul_comm`  -- `re (x * y) = re (y * x)`
* `re_mul_assoc` -- `re ((x * y) * z) = re (x * (y * z))`

Equivalently: every commutator lies in `ker re`, and every associator lies in `ker re`.
This is the standard fact that a composition algebra's trace form `⟨x, y⟩ = re (x ȳ)` is
an *associative* symmetric bilinear form, and it is what makes the trace form on
`h₃(𝕆)` Euclidean rather than merely symmetric.

## Why these two

They are the entry-level input to the trace form on the Albert algebra `h₃(𝕆)`.  The
Euclidean hypothesis carried by the order-unit-space construction of the `EJA` layer,

```
hassoc : ⟪m x y, z⟫ = ⟪y, m x z⟫
```

reduces, on hermitian `3 × 3` octonionic matrices, to exactly these two identities on the
octonionic entries (plus positive-definiteness, `re_mul_conj_self` below, which is
`Octonion.mul_conj` read at coordinate `0`).

## Proofs

`re a` is `a.coords 0`, so -- unlike `left_alternative` or the Moufang identities, which
must be checked in all eight components -- each statement here is a *single* polynomial
identity: degree 2 in 16 variables for `re_mul_comm`, degree 3 in 24 variables for
`re_mul_assoc`.  Both are inside the default heartbeat budget; no `set_option
maxHeartbeats` is needed anywhere in this file.

## Provenance

Written 2026-08-22 for the Albert-algebra branch, which needs the trace form on `h₃(𝕆)`
before the `EJA/` layer (spectral theorem included) can apply to it.  These lemmas were
absent from `Octonions.lean` and `OctonionNucleus.lean`.
