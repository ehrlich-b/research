# The Cayley–Dickson double as an external type former

`Composition/Doubling.lean` doubles *inside* a composition algebra `C`: given a composition
subalgebra `A ≤ C` and a unit `u ⊥ A`, the submodule `A ⊕ A u` is again a composition
subalgebra. That is all Hurwitz's *dimension* bound needs, and it is cheap because the
composition law of `C` is already available.

The *classification* needs the other half: a functor `D ↦ CD D` producing a **new** algebra,
so that the chain of subalgebras can be identified with concrete carriers rather than merely
counted. This file builds it.

## Main definitions

* `CompositionAlgebra.CD D` — the double `D × D` with
  `(a,b)(c,d) = (a c - d* b, d a + b c*)` and `1 = (1,0)`.
* `CompositionAlgebra.CD.bilin` — the form `⟪(a,b), (c,d)⟫ = ⟪a,c⟫ + ⟪b,d⟫`.

## Main results

* `CD.instNonAssocRing`, `CD.instModule`, and the two bilinearity classes — `CD D` is a
  bilinear unital ring over `ℝ` whenever `D` is.
* `CD.instCompositionAlgebra` — **`CD D` is a Euclidean composition algebra when `D` is
  associative.** Associativity is used exactly once, in the cross term of the composition law:
  expanding `N((a,b)(c,d)) = N(a,b) N(c,d)` leaves the residue
  `⟪d a, b c*⟫ = ⟪a c, d* b⟫`, and the two adjoint identities turn each side into
  `⟪a, (d* b) c*⟫` and `⟪a, d* (b c*)⟫` respectively.

★ This is the same mechanism as `IsCompSubalgebra.forced_assoc`, read in the other direction:
there, multiplicativity of the norm on `A ⊕ A u` is free (it is inherited from `C`) and forces
`A` associative; here, `D` associative is a hypothesis and buys multiplicativity of the norm on
the new type.

## Note on the conjugation

`CD` is built over `CompositionAlgebra D`, whose conjugation `cstar` is *derived* from the form
rather than supplied as a `Star` structure. An upstreamed version would take `[Star D]` and a
`StarRing` hypothesis; here the derived conjugation keeps the four concrete instantiations free
of bridging lemmas.
