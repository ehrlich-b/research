# The Cayley–Dickson doubling, internally

Let `C` be a Euclidean composition algebra, `A ⊆ C` a **composition subalgebra** (a submodule
containing `1` and closed under multiplication and conjugation), and `u ⊥ A` a unit vector.
This file proves the three multiplication rules that make `A ⊕ A u` the Cayley–Dickson double
of `A`:

* `mul_mul_unit` — `a (b u) = (b a) u`
* `unit_mul_mul` — `(a u) b = (a b*) u`
* `unit_mul_unit` — `(a u)(b u) = -(b* a)`

together with the orthogonality `ip_mul_unit` (`⟪a u, b⟫ = 0`) that makes the sum direct.

## Why this file is not the plan's `Composition/CayleyDickson.lean`

The build plan proposed constructing `CD C := C × C` as a *new* algebra and then transporting
it into `C`. That is not what Hurwitz's argument needs and it is the expensive half: it means
building a second `NonAssocRing` instance, a second form, and an isomorphism onto a subalgebra.
Everything downstream instead needs the doubling *inside* `C`, where the composition law is
already available and where `A ⊕ A u` is a submodule rather than a new type. So the doubling
is done internally, and no `CD` type former is built.

★ **The rules need no associativity of `A`.** The plan's §6 flagged the termination step
("the doubling stops at dimension 8 because `CD D` composes only when `D` is associative") as
the one it had not written out to the level where a Lean gap would show. It was right to flag
it, and the shape of the gap is this: the three rules above hold for *any* composition
subalgebra `A`, associative or not, so **closure of `A ⊕ A u` is not where the dimension bound
comes from**. What associativity actually gates is the *norm* on `A ⊕ A u`, and inside `C` the
norm is multiplicative for free. The bound therefore arrives as a contrapositive — if `A` is
not associative there is no unit vector orthogonal to it at all — which is
`Composition/Hurwitz.lean`, not this file.

## Main statements

The named results are the four listed above plus their inputs: `cstar_mul_mul`
(`x* (x y) = N x • y`) and `mul_mul_cstar` (`(y x) x* = N x • y`) with their polarisations
`cstar_mul_mul_polar` / `mul_mul_cstar_polar`, and the two commutation rules
`unit_comm` (`a u = u a*`) and `unit_mul_left` (`u (a* y) = a (u y)`).
