# Hurwitz's theorem: the dimension of a Euclidean composition algebra is 1, 2, 4 or 8

`finrank_eq_one_or_two_or_four_or_eight` : a finite-dimensional Euclidean composition algebra
has real dimension `1`, `2`, `4` or `8`. `Composition/Instances.lean` exhibits `ℝ`, `ℂ`, `ℍ`,
`𝕆` at each of the four, so all four occur.

## The argument, and where the bound actually comes from

Start with `A₀ = ℝ ∙ 1` and double: while the current composition subalgebra `A` is proper,
`exists_unit_orthogonal` produces a unit `u ⊥ A` and `Composition/Doubling.lean`'s three rules
make `A ⊕ A u` a composition subalgebra of twice the dimension. So `finrank C` is a power of
two, and the whole content of the theorem is that the fourth doubling is impossible.

★ The build plan said the doubling stops "because `CD D` composes only when `D` is
associative", and flagged that it had not written this out to the level where a Lean gap would
show. Written out, the mechanism is **not** the one the phrase suggests, and the difference
matters:

* Closure of `A ⊕ A u` is unconditional — `Doubling.lean` proves the three rules with no
  associativity hypothesis. So the doubling never fails to *close*.
* What fails is the *norm*. Inside `C` the norm form is multiplicative by hypothesis, so
  expanding `N(xy) = N x N y` on `x = a + bu`, `y = c + du` yields, after both adjoint
  identities, `⟪b, (da)c⟫ = ⟪b, d(ac)⟫` for all `b ∈ A` — and `A` is nondegenerate, so **`A`
  is associative**. That is `forced_assoc`, and it is a *hypothesis* on `A` extracted from the
  mere existence of `u`, not a property of a separately constructed `CD A`.

★ Finite-dimensionality is used in exactly one place, `exists_unit_orthogonal`. The three
structural lemmas `forced_assoc`, `comm_of_assoc_double` and `le_span_one_of_comm_double` are
proved without it, as the `omit` lines above them record.

So the bound is a contrapositive: a composition subalgebra that is not associative has no unit
vector orthogonal to it, hence is everything. Two more steps localise the failure:
`comm_of_assoc_double` (if `A ⊕ A u` is associative then `A` is commutative) and
`le_span_one_of_comm_double` (if `A ⊕ A u` is commutative then `A ⊆ ℝ ∙ 1`). At the fourth
doubling these chain to `finrank A₁ ≤ 1`, contradicting `finrank A₁ = 2`.

## What is *not* proved here

The **classification** — that a Euclidean composition algebra is *isomorphic to* `ℝ`, `ℂ`, `ℍ`
or `𝕆` — is not proved. Only the dimension is. Building the four isomorphisms needs the chain
to be identified with the concrete carriers step by step, which is a separate construction.
See `WallCertificates/HurwitzClassification.lean` for what is missing and what it would need.
