# The three base identifications

`CD ℝ ≃ ℂ`, `CD ℂ ≃ ℍ` and `CD ℍ ≃ 𝕆`, each as an isomorphism of composition algebras.

These are item (3) of `WallCertificates/hurwitz-classification.lean`, which itemises what
turning Hurwitz's *dimension* theorem into Hurwitz's *classification* still needs: (1) the
external `CD` functor, built in `Composition/CayleyDickson.lean`; (2) a transport lemma
identifying `CD D` with the internal double `double A u` of `Composition/Doubling.lean`; and
(3) these three. ★ Item (2) is **not** in this file: it is `CompEmb.double` in
`Composition/Classification.lean`, which also assembles all three items into
`hurwitz_classification`. This file proves only the base cases.

## Main definitions

* `CompositionAlgebra.IsCompIso` — an isomorphism of composition algebras: an `ℝ`-linear
  equivalence preserving the unit, the product **and the norm form**.
* `cdRealEquiv : CD ℝ ≃ₗ[ℝ] ℂ`, `cdComplexEquiv : CD ℂ ≃ₗ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]`,
  `cdQuaternionEquiv : CD ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₗ[ℝ] Octonion`.

## The octonion identification

★ The third is the only one that needed searching. This tree's `Octonion` is built from a
hard-coded Fano multiplication table (`Octonions.lean`, `Octonion.mul`), not from a doubling,
so matching it against `CD ℍ[ℝ]` means choosing a correspondence between the doubled basis
`1, i, j, k, ℓ, iℓ, jℓ, kℓ` and `e₀, …, e₇` and then checking all 8 × 8 basis products.

The correspondence used below is

```
(a, b) ↦ (a.re, a.imI, a.imJ, b.re, a.imK, b.imJ, -b.imK, b.imI)
```

i.e. `1 ↦ e₀`, `i ↦ e₁`, `j ↦ e₂`, `k ↦ e₄`, `ℓ ↦ e₃`, `iℓ ↦ e₇`, `jℓ ↦ e₅`, `kℓ ↦ -e₆`.
It was found by enumerating the signed correspondences determined by the images of `i`, `j`
and `ℓ` and testing each against the table; **1344 of the 2744 candidates work**, and none of
them is sign-free. The one above is among the 147 that flip exactly one sign.

★ **Read the scope of that count exactly.** The enumeration ranges over the *monomial*
correspondences — those sending each of `1, i, j, k, ℓ, iℓ, jℓ, kℓ` to a signed basis vector —
and it is complete for those, since multiplicativity determines the other five images from the
images of `i`, `j` and `ℓ`, and each of those has 14 possibilities. It says nothing about
isomorphisms `CD ℍ[ℝ] ≃ 𝕆` in general: `Aut(𝕆) = G₂` is 14-dimensional, so almost none of them
are monomial. "No sign-free correspondence" means no sign-free *monomial* one.

★ Note what this does *not* say: the search establishes that the two products agree, not that
the labelling is canonical. A different Fano convention would produce a different
correspondence, and nothing downstream depends on which one is used.

/-- An **isomorphism of composition algebras**: an `ℝ`-linear equivalence preserving the unit,
the product and the norm form.

★ The norm clause is not redundant *bookkeeping* — it is carried because everything downstream
needs it and because `sq_eq`'s argument that the product already determines `N` is not
formalized in this tree. Carrying it makes every statement below strictly stronger than the
unit-and-product-only notion. -/

  rw [cstar_apply, h]
  ext <;> simp <;> ring

/-! The four *components* of the quaternionic conjugation, and not `Quaternion.cstar_eq`, are
what carries the `simp` normal form.

★ This is not a stylistic choice. Mathlib's `Quaternion.re_mul` and its three companions are
`simp` lemmas keyed on `(a * b).re`, and they fail to fire when the first factor is a structure
literal. With `Quaternion.cstar_eq` marked `@[simp]`, these two behave differently —

```
example (a b : ℍ[ℝ]) : (a * b).re = a.re*b.re - a.imI*b.imI - a.imJ*b.imJ - a.imK*b.imK := by
  simp
example (a b : ℍ[ℝ]) : (cstar a * b).re = a.re*b.re + a.imI*b.imI + a.imJ*b.imJ + a.imK*b.imK := by
  simp; ring
```

— the first closes, and the second leaves `({ re := a.re, imI := -a.imI, … } * b).re` for
`ring`, which cannot touch it. Rewriting `cstar` componentwise keeps the product's arguments
atomic, so the four Mathlib lemmas fire and the octonion `map_mul` below reduces to
coordinates. -/
