# A carrier for `EuclideanJordanAlgebra`

`EJA/Class.lean` names the Euclidean Jordan algebra hypothesis as a class, and `EJA/Rank.lean`,
`EJA/FrameExists.lean` and `EJA/FramePeirce.lean` state their results over it.  Until this file
the **only** instances of that class in the tree were `EJA/PeirceSubalgebra.lean`'s two, and both
are conditional on an ambient `[EuclideanJordanAlgebra J]`, so nothing exhibited a base model:
`exists_jordanFrame` and `frameBlock_isInternal` were universally quantified over a class no
object was known to inhabit.

This file supplies the base model.  `H_n(𝕜)` — Hermitian matrices over `𝕜 = ℝ` or `ℂ` under the
symmetrized product `A ∘ B = ½(AB + BA)` and the real trace form — is a `EuclideanJordanAlgebra`.

★ **This is the same exposure ARC-6 shipped and had to repair.**  Two abstract rows landed
FORMALIZED carrying `IsArchimedean` as a hypothesis with no carrier known to satisfy it;
`HermitianMat.isArchimedean` was proved to retire that caveat, and `EJA/Witness.lean`'s
`instIsFormallyReal` and `diagFrame_orthIdem` retired it for `IsFormallyReal` and
`IsOrthIdemFamily`.  The class was the last hypothesis in the layer with no witness.

## No field needed new mathematics

Every one of the class's six field obligations was already proved in the tree, in
`jordanBilinG` or `symmMul` vocabulary:

| class field | discharged by |
| --- | --- |
| `mul_comm` | `HermitianMat.symmMul_comm` |
| `add_mul` | bilinearity of `Necessity.jordanBilinG` |
| `smul_mul` | bilinearity of `Necessity.jordanBilinG` |
| `one_mul` | `HermitianMat.one_symmMul` |
| `jordan` | `EJA/Order.lean`'s `hermitian_jordan_id` (the vendored `IsCommJordan`) |
| `inner_assoc` | `EJA/Order.lean`'s `hermitian_jordan_assoc` |

The three lemmas before the instance are re-orientations, not new results: two unbundle
`jordanBilinG`'s `LinearMap` structure, and `hermitian_symmMul_jordan` turns Mathlib's
`lmul_comm_rmul_rmul` orientation into the class's by commuting the product twice.

## The diamond `EJA/Class.lean` warned about, measured

`EJA/Class.lean` records that `instNonUnitalNonAssocCommRing` fires on any type carrying the
class, that `HermitianMat d 𝕜` already carries a `Mul` from
`RadicalRelativity/Vendor/HermitianMat/Jordan.lean`'s `scoped instance : CommMagma`, and that
"if one is ever declared, that scoped instance and this class's `toMul` will both be in scope
inside `open HermMul` sections and one of them has to give way."

That is now declared, and the collision is **definitional**: `hermMul_toMul_eq` below is `rfl`.
Both `Mul` structures have `HermitianMat.symmMul` as their multiplication, so which one instance
search returns does not change any statement.  Concretely, inside an `open HermMul` section with
this instance in scope, `#synth Mul (HermitianMat (Fin 2) ℂ)` returns *this* instance's `toMul`
(the global instance outranks the opened scoped one), `HermMul.mul_eq_symmMul` still typechecks,
and `EJA/Order.lean`'s two `open HermMul` proofs — `hermitian_jordan_id` and
`hermitian_formallyReal` — still go through unaltered.

★ Two things this does *not* claim.  It is not claimed that the collision is invisible: instance
search does return a different term inside `open HermMul` once this module is imported, and a
proof that pins the instance by name rather than by its product would notice.  And it is not
claimed that anything currently pays that cost — **no module in the tree imports this one**, so
the four existing `open HermMul` sites (`EJA/Order.lean`, `EJA/Spectral.lean`, `EJA/Witness.lean`,
`EJA/ConcreteInstance.lean`) are all upstream of this file and see exactly what they saw before.

★ One elaboration trap, recorded because it cost a probe round.  Inside the structure-instance
notation, `simpa only [...] using e` **fails** on fields whose statement is in `*` form while `e`
is in `symmMul` form, reporting a type mismatch between `(A + B) * C` and `(A + B).symmMul C`
even though the two are `rfl`-equal (`hermitian_mul_eq_symmMul` below).  The named-lemma route
(`add_mul A B C := hermitian_symmMul_add_left A B C`) succeeds on the same goal.  So the
mismatch is `simpa`'s reducibility setting, not a real failure of the defeq — do not conclude
from such a message that the product is wrong.

## Scope

**No manifest row moves.**  This file is substrate.  What changes is that the M3/M4 results are
now known to be about a nonempty class: `hermitian_exists_jordanFrame` and
`hermitian_frameBlock_isInternal` are `exists_jordanFrame` and `frameBlock_isInternal` read on
`H_n(𝕜)`.

★ The last section goes past existence and **names a frame** on `H_n(ℂ)`: `diagJordanFrame`, the
diagonal matrix units of `EJA/Witness.lean` reindexed along `Fintype.equivFin`.  That needed one
piece of genuinely new mathematics — `diagFrame_isPrimitive`, which `EJA/Witness.lean` does not
prove and which is the only obligation of `JordanFrame` its `diagFrame_orthIdem` and
`diagFrame_sum` do not already discharge.  ★ Note what primitivity is **not**: it is not
`dim V_ii = 1`, and this file does not prove that.  Two scope limits on the frame: it is over
`ℂ` only, because `EJA/Witness.lean`'s `diagFrame` is, and its cardinality is `Fintype.card n`,
which is **not** proved to be the rank — `EJA/Rank.lean` proves only `card ≤ rank` and
`card ≤ finrank`.

blocks. -/

    DirectSum.IsInternal (frameBlock F) :=

/-- **(M3) and (M4) together on `H_n(𝕜)`**: the algebra has a Jordan frame, and that frame
decomposes it.  This is the statement that was universally quantified over an unwitnessed class

/-! ## A named frame on `H_n(ℂ)`

`EJA/Witness.lean` builds the diagonal matrix units `E_ii` and proves them orthogonal
idempotents summing to the unit.  That is three of `JordanFrame`'s four fields.  The missing one
is **primitivity**, which is proved here and is the only new mathematics in this file.

The argument is entrywise and short.  If `d` is fixed by `E_ii ∘ -` then reading the `(a, b)`
entry of `½(E_ii D + D E_ii) = D` gives `D_ab = 0` off `(i, i)` — the three off-diagonal cases
reduce to `½ D_ab = D_ab` or to `0 = D_ab` — so `D = D_ii · E_ii`.  Idempotency then forces
`D_ii² = D_ii` at the surviving entry, so `D_ii ∈ {0, 1}` and `d` is `0` or `E_ii`. -/
