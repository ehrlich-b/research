# Koecher / Alfsen–Shultz: a unital linear order isomorphism is a Jordan automorphism

On a finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebra, a linear bijection `Φ` that fixes the unit
and preserves the cone of sums of squares **in both directions** preserves the Jordan product.

This is the classical theorem — Koecher; Alfsen–Shultz, *Geometry of State Spaces*, Thm 2.80.  It is
**not** van Imhoff–Roelands' JB-generality version (arXiv:1904.09278), which concludes linearity
rather than assuming it.  Here `Φ : J ≃ₗ[ℝ] J` is linear **by type**, and that is the whole
difference.

## The route

Jordan-multiplicativity reduces to preservation of squares, and squares to preservation of
idempotents, provided idempotents can be recognised *order-theoretically*.  They can:

* `c` is idempotent **iff** `c` is **sharp** — `0 ≤ c ≤ e` and no nonzero element of the cone lies
  below both `c` and `e − c` (`isSharp_iff_idem`).

Sharpness is visibly transported by `Φ`, since every clause is a statement about the cone and the
unit; so `Φ` maps idempotents to idempotents.  A complete orthogonal family `∑ qᵢ = e` goes to a
family with `∑ Φqᵢ = e`, and orthogonality is then *recovered* rather than transported
(`orth_of_sum_eq_unit`).  Finally `x = ∑ λᵢ qᵢ ⟹ x ∘ x = ∑ λᵢ² qᵢ` gives `Φ(x ∘ x) = Φx ∘ Φx`, and
polarisation finishes it.

★ **The reflecting half of the order hypothesis is load-bearing.**  `horder` is a *biconditional*.
A one-directional `IsSoS x → IsSoS (Φ x)` would not do: the sharpness clause is a `∀` over the cone,
and transporting it along `Φ.symm` needs the converse.  This is checked, not assumed — see
`map_idem_of_orderIso`, where `(horder _).mpr` appears three times.

## What the argument runs on

Two facts about the cone, both of which need an **associative positive definite form**:

* a sum of squares has nonnegative spectral coefficients (`nonneg_coeff`);
* the **face lemma**: `0 ≤ x ≤ c` with `c` idempotent forces `c ∘ x = x` (`face_lemma`).

`EJA/Order.lean` proves the first from the *ambient* inner product, under the hypothesis that the
inner product is associative for the Jordan product.  That hypothesis is exactly what
`MasterTheorem/Interface.lean`'s `ComparisonSetup` does not carry, which is why this file pairs
against `EJA/TraceForm.lean`'s `traceForm` instead: a form built from the algebra, so nothing has to
be assumed about an ambient one.  Both facts are proved here from scratch in that vocabulary; the
`inner`-shaped originals in `EJA/Order.lean` are untouched and are not used.

## Extreme points are not needed

The natural-looking characterisation — `c` is idempotent iff it is an extreme point of `[0, e]`,
mirroring `Hermitian/ExtremeEffects.lean`'s `mem_extremePoints_iff_isProjection` — is **avoided
deliberately**.  Both of its directions bottom out in the same face lemma, and it additionally drags
in Mathlib's `Set.extremePoints` and convexity API and forces `[0, e]` to be stated as a `Set`.
Sharpness needs neither.  The concrete `HermitianMat` result is not reusable here in any case: its
proof is matrix-level.

★ `RadicalRelativity/OrderUnitSpace.lean` carries an `IsSharp` of its own, and this file does
**not** use it or bridge to it.  That one is stated over an `OrderUnitSpace` instance, and getting
one here would mean instantiating `EJA/Order.lean`'s `orderUnitSpaceOfBilinear` — a `def`, whose
own docstring warns that instantiating it puts a second `PartialOrder J` in scope.  The two are the
same condition written in different vocabularies; no lemma below asserts that, and none needs to.

## What this closes, and what it does not

It discharges `WallCertificates/eja-gated.lean`'s `gate_E3_theta_jordan`, the last `sorry` in that
file, so `ComparisonSetup.Θ_jordan` becomes derivable for any instance carrying `JBPremises`.

★★ **It moves no manifest row, and this is not a hedge.**  Row 13's gate is (E1), not (E3).  Row 16
never consumes `Θ_jordan` — `coalescence_J2q`'s whole proof term is `Θ_fix` composed with
`simDiag_opCommute`.  Row 17 is WALL-CERTIFIED, its residue analytic and group-theoretic.  Row 14
`prop:theta` has three clauses — the construction of `Θ_a` from the sequential product (vdW Prop
5.3), the Jordan-automorphism upgrade, and the fixing/cocycle clauses (vdW Props 5.5, 5.7) — and
this closes **one** of the three; the row's terminal state is EXTERNAL by pre-registration, which is
a campaign decision this file does not touch.

the pairing vanishes: `τ(c ∘ y, y)` is the sum of two squares of the form, one for each nonzero
Peirce eigenvalue of `c`.

`L_c = P₁(c) + ½ P_{1/2}(c)`; both Peirce projections are self-adjoint for `τ` (associativity, three
times) and idempotent, so `τ(P y, y) = τ(P y, P y)`.

/-- **A unital linear order isomorphism preserves squares.**

The image of a complete orthogonal family is a family of idempotents summing to the unit, hence
pairwise orthogonal by `orth_of_sum_eq_unit`; squaring is then coefficientwise on both sides. -/

/-- **Koecher / Alfsen–Shultz.**  A unital linear order isomorphism of a finite-dimensional formally
real Jordan algebra is a Jordan automorphism.

Polarisation: `2 (x ∘ y) = (x + y)² − x² − y²`, and `Φ` is linear, so preservation of squares is
preservation of the product once the `2` is cancelled. -/

/-! ## The theorem in `MasterTheorem/Interface.lean`'s vocabulary

The crossing `EJA/Bridge.lean` was built for: the *statement* mentions only the bundled bilinear
map, so no ring instance has to exist before it elaborates; only the proof needs one. -/

section Interface

variable {J : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup J] [Module ℝ J] [Module.Finite ℝ J]

/-- **Koecher / Alfsen–Shultz, in bilinear-map vocabulary.**  The Jordan product as a bundled
bilinear map, the Jordan identity and formal reality as hypotheses in that vocabulary, and the cone
as `EJA/Order.lean`'s `IsSoS`.

★ No inner product appears.  The ambient structure is a normed additive group carrying an
`ℝ`-module structure — `NormedAddCommGroup` only because `EJA/Bridge.lean`'s `ringOfBilinear` is
stated over one — and the norm is never used. -/
