# Peirce subalgebras: `J₂(c)` and `J₀(c)` as Euclidean Jordan algebras in their own right

`EJA/Peirce.lean` carries the Peirce decomposition at a single idempotent as three *linear
maps* `peirceOne c`, `peirceHalf c`, `peirceZero c`, and `EJA/PeirceMul.lean` carries the six
Faraut–Korányi rules governing how their images multiply.  Two of those rules —
`eigen_one_mul_one` and `eigen_zero_mul_zero` — say that the eigenvalue-`1` and eigenvalue-`0`
eigenspaces are closed under the product.  This file turns that closure into structure: each
of the two eigenspaces is itself a Euclidean Jordan algebra, with its own unit.

Everything that recurses into a Peirce subalgebra sits on this file.

## The subobject vehicle: `Submodule`, not `NonUnitalSubalgebra`

★ **This is a deviation from the build plan, and it is what made the module cheap.**  The plan
routed the two eigenspaces through `NonUnitalSubalgebra ℝ J` and priced the module at its
risk #3, on a probe showing that `IsCommJordan ↥S` does not synthesise for a
`NonUnitalSubalgebra` subtype: Mathlib has no such transfer instance, so one would have to be
written, and `IsFormallyReal` with it.

That probe reproduces here, re-run against this tree on 2026-08-22: with
`[EuclideanJordanAlgebra J]` in context,
`example (S : NonUnitalSubalgebra ℝ J) : IsCommJordan ↥S := inferInstance` fails to synthesise,
while the same `example` for `NonUnitalNonAssocCommRing ↥S` succeeds.  The conclusion drawn from
it still does not apply, because under `EJA/Class.lean`'s design **no transfer is needed**.
The class puts `Mul` and `One` on top of an inner-product space rather than alongside a ring
structure, so the natural subobject is the same shape one level down: the ambient
`Submodule ℝ J`, whose subtype already carries
`NormedAddCommGroup`, `InnerProductSpace ℝ` and `Module ℝ` from Mathlib, with `Mul` and `One`
added on top.  Then `EuclideanJordanAlgebra ↥(peirceOneSub hc)` is *constructed* from six
field proofs, every one of which is the ambient identity read through `Subtype.ext`, and
`IsCommJordan`, `IsScalarTower`, `SMulCommClass` and the ring structure then arrive on the
subtype the same way they arrive on `J`: as `EJA/Class.lean`'s derived instances.  Nothing is
transferred because nothing has to be.

★ **One rough edge, measured rather than predicted.**  `IsFormallyReal ↥(peirceOneSub hc)` does
*not* come back from a bare `inferInstance`, though `IsCommJordan ↥(peirceOneSub hc)`,
`IsScalarTower`, `SMulCommClass` and `NonUnitalNonAssocCommRing` all do.  The cause is
`IsFormallyReal`'s keying: it is indexed on `[Mul J]` **and** `[AddCommMonoid J]` as two
independent arguments, and on a `Submodule` subtype a bare goal picks
`(peirceOneSub hc).addCommMonoid` while `EJA/Class.lean`'s instance carries the
ring-derived `AddCommMonoid`.  The two are **definitionally equal** — both `rfl`-checked, as are
the two `Mul` paths — so this is an elaboration-order artifact and not a diamond, and it costs
nothing where it matters: every consumer in the tree demands `IsFormallyReal` downstream of a
`NonUnitalNonAssocCommRing` argument, so the ring-derived path is the one in the goal and the
instance matches.  `spectral_resolution_complete'` therefore runs inside `J₂(c)` unaided.
Should a bare goal ever be wanted, `EuclideanJordanAlgebra.instIsFormallyReal
(J := ↥(peirceOneSub hc))` supplies it — pinning the type is what fixes it, since without it the
instance arguments are synthesised against a metavariable.  No such instance is declared here,
because nothing needs one.

Three facts make this work.  None is asserted here on the strength of a past probe: each is
re-checked every time the file compiles, at the declaration named after it.

* `NormedAddCommGroup ↥W` and `InnerProductSpace ℝ ↥W` synthesise for any `W : Submodule ℝ J` —
  without which `instEJAPeirceOneSub` could not even be stated, since the class is indexed by
  them;
* the inner product on the subtype is the ambient one **by `rfl`**, which is why
  `instEJAPeirceOneSub`'s `inner_assoc` field is the ambient `inner_assoc` applied to the
  coercions with no rewriting at all;
* membership in the two carriers is *definitionally* the eigenvalue equation, which is why
  `instMulPeirceOneSub` passes `eigen_one_mul_one hc x.2 y.2` straight in as the closure proof
  and `instEJAPeirceOneSub`'s `one_mul` field is `Subtype.ext x.2`.

The plan's *specific* warning — that the class carries `One`, so the instance on `J₂(q)` is
constructed with `1 = q` rather than derived, and `simp`-normal-form care is owed around
`(1 : ↥S)` — is exactly right and is paid here by `coe_one_peirceOneSub` and
`coe_one_peirceZeroSub`, two `@[simp]` lemmas pinning `((1 : ↥(peirceOneSub hc)) : J) = c` and
`((1 : ↥(peirceZeroSub hc)) : J) = 1 - c`.

The `NonUnitalSubalgebra` versions are **not** built.  Nothing downstream needs the subalgebra
lattice, and `Submodule.finrank_lt` — which the dimension-drop lemmas below consume — wants a
`Submodule` anyway.

## Naming: eigenvalues, not Jacobson indices

The literature writes the eigenvalue-`1` and eigenvalue-`0` Peirce spaces as `J₂(c)` and
`J₀(c)`, indexing by twice the eigenvalue.  The tree's existing projections are named by the
eigenvalue itself (`peirceOne`, `peirceHalf`, `peirceZero`), and consistency inside the tree
wins: `peirceOneSub hc` **is** `J₂(c)` and `peirceZeroSub hc` **is** `J₀(c)`.  Reading
`peirceOneSub` as `J₁(c)` — the half-eigenspace — would be a mistake.  The half-eigenspace gets
no subalgebra here, and cannot get one on the same terms: `EJA/PeirceMul.lean`'s
`peirceHalf_mul_half_eq_zero` puts the product of two half-eigenvectors in `J₂(c) ⊕ J₀(c)`, so
the half-eigenspace is closed under the product only in the degenerate case where it squares to
zero.

## Scope

**No manifest row moves.**  This is substrate for the Jordan–von Neumann–Wigner campaign.

/-! ## The dimension drop

The two lemmas that make an induction on `finrank ℝ J` down the Peirce decomposition
terminate.  Each is a one-element argument: if the subalgebra were everything it would contain
the ambient unit (resp. `c` itself), and its defining equation would then force `c = 1`
(resp. `c = 0`). -/

/-! ## `J₂(c)` as an order unit space, and the Peirce clause of `lem:span`

`STATEMENT-MANIFEST.md` row 5 recorded its Peirce clause as open with the reason that the
article "gets [it] by instantiating this lemma at `(J₂(q), q)` — so it follows *once* the tree
knows `J₂(q)` is an order unit space, **which it does not**".

That reason is now out of date rather than wrong-in-kind: `instEJAPeirceOneSub` above makes
`J₂(c)` a Euclidean Jordan algebra in its own right, and `EJA/Order.lean`'s
`orderUnitSpaceOfBilinear` turns any such thing into an order unit space with the cone of sums
of squares and the Jordan unit — here `1 = c`, by `coe_one_peirceOneSub`.  The five arguments
it takes are `EJA/Class.lean`'s `jmulₗ` tuple, supplied by name.  So the clause is an
instantiation, exactly as the article has it, and nothing new is proved about `J₂(c)`. -/

/-- **`J₂(c)` is an order unit space**, with the cone of sums of squares of `J₂(c)` and `c`
itself as the order unit.

A `def`, not an `instance`, for the reason `EJA/Order.lean`'s module docstring gives: the
`NormedAddCommGroup` and `NormedSpace` parents are filled from the ambient submodule instances,
so no second normed structure is created, but registering it globally would put a
`PartialOrder` on every Peirce subalgebra whether or not the order is wanted there. -/
