# The Jordan trace form

`τ(x, y) := tr(L_{x ∘ y})`, where `L_c` is the Jordan multiplication operator `EJA/Peirce.lean`
carries as `mulL`.  On a finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebra this form is symmetric,
**associative** (`τ(x ∘ y, z) = τ(y, x ∘ z)`) and **positive definite** — which is to say, it makes
such an algebra Euclidean without any inner product having been supplied.

## Why this file exists

`EJA/Order.lean`'s Euclidean section — `inner_mul_self_nonneg_of_idem`, `inner_left_coeff`,
`nonneg_coeff_of_isSoS`, `isArchimedean_ofBilinear`, `isSoS_iff_exists_sq` — takes the associativity
of the **ambient** inner product as a hypothesis, `hassoc : ∀ x y z, ⟪m x y, z⟫ = ⟪y, m x z⟫`.  Every
carrier in the tree discharges it by hand.  `MasterTheorem/Interface.lean`'s `ComparisonSetup`
cannot: it carries a `NormedAddCommGroup`/`InnerProductSpace` pair on `J` and a Jordan product
`jordan` as an unrelated field, with **no** compatibility between them, and
`WallCertificates/eja-gated.lean`'s `JBPremises` adds the Jordan identity, formal reality and the
cone-of-squares reading of `nonneg` — not associativity.  So a proof that has to run inside those
hypotheses has no associative form to pair against, and every one of the six results above is
inapplicable as stated.

This file builds the missing form *from the algebra*.  Nothing here mentions a norm or an inner
product; the ambient structure is `EJA/Peirce.lean`'s (a commutative Jordan ring that is an
`ℝ`-module), plus finite-dimensionality and formal reality where the spectral theorem is used.
A consumer working under `ComparisonSetup` installs `EJA/Bridge.lean`'s `ringOfBilinear` and gets
`traceForm` on the nose.

## The associativity argument

`tr(L_·)` is associative because the **quadrilinear** form of the Jordan identity,

`L_{(a∘c)∘y} + L_a L_y L_c + L_c L_y L_a = L_a L_{c∘y} + L_c L_{a∘y} + L_y L_{a∘c}`,

has a right-hand side that is symmetric under permuting `(a, c, y)` — the three pairs
`{(a, c∘y), (c, a∘y), (y, a∘c)}` are permuted among themselves and `tr(fg) = tr(gf)` — while
`tr(L_a L_y L_c) + tr(L_c L_y L_a)` is symmetric by cyclicity of the trace.  Hence
`tr(L_{(a∘c)∘y})` is symmetric in `(a, c, y)`, and that *is* associativity.

★ The quadrilinear identity itself is cheap and this was not expected.  It is the difference of two
instances of Mathlib's own linearized Jordan identity
(`two_nsmul_lie_lmul_lmul_add_add_eq_zero`) with the last two arguments swapped; `jordan_linearized`
and `jordan_quadrilinear` below are the whole of it.

## Positive definiteness

`τ(x, x) = tr(L_{x∘x})`, and the spectral resolution `x = ∑ᵢ λᵢ qᵢ` into orthogonal idempotents
gives `x ∘ x = ∑ᵢ λᵢ² qᵢ`, so `τ(x, x) = ∑ᵢ λᵢ² tr(L_{qᵢ})`.  For an idempotent `c` the split
`L_c = P₁(c) + ½ P_{1/2}(c)` writes `tr(L_c)` as a nonnegative combination of traces of *idempotent
endomorphisms*, which are ranks of their ranges; and `P₁(c) c = c`, so a nonzero `c` forces
`tr(L_c) ≥ 1`.  That inequality is the whole of definiteness: a vanishing `τ(x, x)` kills every
coefficient whose idempotent is nonzero.

★ **What this file does NOT claim.**  `τ` is not shown to be *the* Jordan trace form in the sense of
Faraut–Korányi (the trace of the quadratic representation, or the sum of the eigenvalues of `x`);
`tr(L_e)` is `finrank ℝ J`, not the rank of `J`.  Nothing downstream needs the normalisation, and
`EJA/Class.lean`'s `EuclideanJordanAlgebra` deliberately takes an *arbitrary* associative positive
definite form rather than a normalised one, so `traceForm` is admissible there as it stands.

Mathlib states it as `2 • ([L_{ab}, L_c] + [L_{bc}, L_a] + [L_{ca}, L_b]) = 0` in
`AddMonoid.End J`; applying that at `v`, unfolding the commutators and cancelling the `2` gives the
form below.  The `have h3 : … := h2` step works because the `AddMonoid.End` ring operations are
definitionally pointwise, which saves fighting for application `simp` lemmas that do not exist
under the names one would guess. -/
